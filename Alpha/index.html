        <h2>Original Interface</h2>
        <p>
            The Alpha microinteraction aims to improve the search functionality on the <a href="http://www.streamlord.com/">streamlord</a> website, which hosts movies. Currently, the search feature lacks real-time feedback and user-friendly interactions.
        </p>

        <p>
        The Alpha microinteraction is a targeted enhancement designed to elevate the user experience of the search functionality on the streamlord website, a platform dedicated to hosting movies. Presently, the website's search feature is marked by a few key limitations that hinder its overall usability and user-friendliness.
         </p>
        <p>
        Firstly, the absence of real-time feedback in the current search system is a notable issue. When users interact with the search bar by typing their queries, they do not receive immediate suggestions or hints to guide their search. This lack of real-time assistance can lead to frustration and slower search experiences, especially for users who are unsure about the exact movie title they are looking for.
        </p>
        <p>
        Additionally, the existing search interactions on streamlord lack user-friendliness. There is room for improvement in terms of how the search results are presented, how quickly users can access relevant information, and how intuitive the overall search process is. This current state of the search feature may result in users spending more time and effort than necessary to find the movies they want to watch.
        </p>
        <p>
        The objective of the Alpha microinteraction is to address these shortcomings and provide a seamless and efficient search experience for streamlord users. By introducing real-time feedback and enhancing user interactions, we aim to make searching for movies on streamlord more intuitive, responsive, and user-centric. Ultimately, the Alpha microinteraction strives to transform the search functionality into a valuable and user-friendly tool that enhances the overall enjoyment of the streamlord platform

    <section id="triggers">
        <h2>Triggers</h2>
        <p>
            The microinteraction will be triggered when a user interacts with the website's search bar. Specifically, it will respond to the following events:
            <ul>
                <li>Clicking inside the search bar.
                    <p>
                            This event signifies the user's intent to initiate a search
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>Typing a search query.
                    <p>
                        The microinteraction responds dynamically in real-time as the user inputs their search query, providing suggestions and feedback.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>Pressing the Enter key after entering a search query.
                    <p>
                        When the user completes their query and presses Enter, the microinteraction processes the search and displays relevant results or feedback
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>

                <li>If no search results are found, display a clear "No results found" message.</li>
                <li>If search results are available, display them below the search bar without requiring additional clicks.</li>
                <li>Add subtle animations to the search button and search results for visual feedback.</li>
            </ol>

                <li>SEE real-time search suggestions appearing as they type.</li>
                <li>HEAR no specific audio feedback (unless audio feedback is a part of the website's overall design).</li>

    <section id="loops-modes">
        <h2>Loops & Modes</h2>
